----------

Candidate
---------
**Name**: Leandro Cortese<br>
**Email**: leandrocortese@mail.com

Project Requirements
-
**Apache**: >= 2.4.x
**PHP**: >= 5.3
**MySql**: >= 5.6.x

Deploy
------
**Apache**
The project must run with PHP but served with Apache. I recommend create a virtual host from the /public folder to run the application, but If you run it into the browser as: http://localhost/ouverture/public also should works fine.

**Data Base**
Import /sql/overture_dev.sql into your local service of MySql

**Site Configuration**
Rename file /.env.php.example as .env.php and edit his values to math with your DB configuration.

Developer Notes
---------------
The points required on the test could be a bit confused. I decided implement a mix of good practices. However there are much methods to resolve the same exercise.
I preferred do a more solid PHP structure and a bit use of javascript only to perform the required points.
This test could be perfomed with more front specific frontend frameworks, as Angular.
But for matter of time, I decided create a simple js file because the requeriments for js test were not complex.

Please let me know if some feature is out of the project.
